# Value Gateway Protocol (VGP-00)

**Status:** Draft v0.1 — Published by Ledger of Earth  
**Spec URL:** [/specs/VGP-00.md](./specs/VGP-00.md)  
**Documentation Site:** https://ledgerofearth.github.io/vgp/

VGP defines a **trust-boundary protocol** for quoting, selecting, locking, and settling *value paths* across administrative or agentic domains.

It operates **above x402**, using extensible settlement mechanisms to ensure atomic value transfer while isolating financial logic from router control planes.

## Core Principles

- **Path-vector negotiation** (like BGP, but for value)
- **Per-request lifecycle:** `DISCOVER → QUOTED → SELECTED → LOCKED → SERVING → PROVED → SETTLED → CLOSED`
- **Secure mTLS peering** with signed adverts and encrypted TDR logs
- **Policy enforcement** at gateway boundaries for compliance and risk management
- **Extensible attribute registry** for QoS, risk, compliance, and escrow types

## Implementation Notes

VGP itself is agnostic to wallet mapping or escrow design.  
Implementations **MAY**:
- Use E-NAT-style border wallets for policy isolation
- Use HTLC or other escrow mechanisms for settlement (state channels, ZK-attested transfers, trusted custodial escrow)
- Choose any combination that satisfies atomic settlement and refund safety requirements

Both settlement mechanisms and enforcement architecture are deploy-time choices, not part of the VGP specification.
